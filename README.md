In this project, we were tasked to make a website for a museum to show off our design, HTML, and CSS capabilities. 

## Description

For this project, I wanted to make a fun and playful design. It was originally designed in Figma. I wanted the website's target audience to be kids and teenagers. I used interactive elements such as sliders and hover effects to achieve this. For the slider, I dipped my toes in some javascript for the first time which went pretty well. In the assignment, we were tasked with user stories to complete, all of which were fulfilled.
